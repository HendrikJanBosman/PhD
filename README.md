Background documentation and data files to my PhD thesis, '*Prosodic Influence on the Text Syntax of Lamentations*' (the dissertation itself is accessible at http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2613385. The Python sources of my programs `labelman` and `unitman`can be found in `HendrikJanBosman/emdrosapp_src`.

## Documentation:

**Lam.cl_hier.pdf**: Display of my clause hierarchies of Lamentations, in the form of a booklet

**annot.pdf**: My research notes and annotations on the clause hierarchies in Lamentations.

## Data:

**threni_hjb.mql**: My Emdros /MQL database of Lamentations (based on the ETCBC database). Requires Emdros to be queried.

**lbl.zip**: MQL files, defining descriptive linguistic labels. Designed to be processed by my Emdros-based program labelman, but human-readable for those familiar with the MQL query language.
